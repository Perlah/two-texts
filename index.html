<br>Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
<br>On a black throne reigns upright,
<br>I have reached these lands but newly
<br>From an ultimate dim Thule -
<br>From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,</br>
<b>Out of SPACE -- out of TIME.</b>
<br>Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
<br>And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
<br>With forms that no man can discover
<br>For the dews that drip all over;
<br>Mountains toppling evermore
<br><button>Into seas without a shore;</button>
<br>Seas that restlessly aspire,
<br>Surging, unto skies of fire;
<br>Lakes that endlessly outspread
<br><b><p><i>Their lone waters - lone and dead, --</i>
<br><i>Their still waters - still and chilly</i></b></p>
<br>With the snows of the lolling lily.</br>
