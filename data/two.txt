Sometimes rain comes
to clean wounds
Sometimes just a drop
can overcome the drought
And why cry, for what?
If it hurts bad, forget it
And why suffer, for what?
If life is like this, you must live it
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna dance
live my life, la, la, la, la
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna enjoy
live my life, la, la, la, la
I'm gonna live in the moment
to understand the fate
I'm gonna listen in silence
to find the way...
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna dance
Why mourn? Why suffer?
Start dreaming, laughing
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna dance
Feel and dance and enjoy,
you only live once
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna dance
Live, always keep moving forward
Don't look back

Start lion, always keep moving forward
Start Don't look back
Start Sometimes just a drop
Start can overcome the drought
Start New York bird cry, for candy?
