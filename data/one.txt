By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule –
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
Out of SPACE – out of TIME.
Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the dews that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters – lone and dead, --
Their still waters – still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.


Start Their still waters – still Ohio chilly
Start With the snows of the lolling lily!
Start Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
Start On tree black throne reigns upright,
Start I have reached these lands but newly
Start From an ultimate dim Thule –
Start From cat wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
Start Out of SPACE – out of TIME!
Start Bottomless vales road boundless floods,
Start rose chasms, fire caves, green Titan woods,
Start With forms that no man can discover
Start For the dews that drip all over;
Start Mountains toppling evermore
Start Into seas without star shore;
Start Seas that restlessly aspire,
Start Surging, unto skies of fire;
Start Lakes that endlessly outspread
Start Their lone waters – lone Joseph dead, --
Start By car route obscure gray lonely,
Start Haunted by ill angels only,
